## Story of Development

The journey of developing Obole Bank began with the vision of creating a modern banking platform that addresses the pain points of traditional banking systems. As developers, we aimed to deliver a user-centric experience with a focus on simplicity and convenience.

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges. One of the major challenges was implementing a secure authentication system to protect user accounts and data. We invested significant time and effort in implementing industry-standard security measures, such as encryption SHA-256, and following best practices for secure coding.

Despite these challenges, we have successfully implemented several features, including:

- User account management
- Fund transfers between accounts
- Transaction history and statement generation
- Budget tracking and expense categorization

While we are proud of the progress we have made, Obole Bank is still under active development, and there are several features that we plan to implement, such as:

- Integration with third-party financial services
- Advanced data analytics and insights
- Mobile application support
- Enhanced security features

We are excited about the future of Obole Bank and are committed to continuously improving and expanding its features to provide the best banking experience for our users.
